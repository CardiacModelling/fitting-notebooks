    "The word \"model\" gets a lot of mileage in computational electrophysiology.\n",
    "This can get a bit confusing, some of the main uses in this tutorial are shown again here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An expression system, or even an isolated myocyte, acts as a biological model for the true system of interest: myocytes in the intact human heart.\n",
    "- A model of an ion current is a set of mathematical equations describing how the state of the underlying ion channels changes in response to a voltage signal. This is the sense in which Myokit uses the word \"model\".\n",
    "- A model in PINTS is something you throw parameters at, that then returns a signal. This is a parametrisable simulation in Myokit.\n",
    "- A noise model describes how the output of a measurement is affected by different noise sources (e.g. anything that isn't the system of interest).\n",
