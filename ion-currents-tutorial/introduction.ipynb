    "## The model\n",
    "\n",
    "The next section describes the model equations. If you like, you can skip past this and go straight to the model implementation below.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all of this tutorial, we use a simple two-gate Hogdkin-Huxley model to describe channel kinetics, and an Ohmic term to describe the driving force:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I(V, t) = g_\\text{max} \\cdot a(V, t) \\cdot r(V, t) \\cdot (V - E)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $g_\\text{max}$ is the maximum conductance, determined by the number of channels and the conductance per channel, but assumed constant for this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables $a$ and $r$ are dimensionless variables that vary between 0 and 1, and describe the fraction of channels in an _activated_ (a) or _recovered_ (r) state.\n",
    "The underlying assumpution is that the current kinetics are described by two independent processes called \"activation\" and \"inactivation\", and that channels must be \"activated\" and \"recovered from inactivation\" to conduct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, $g_\\text{max} \\cdot a \\cdot r$ represent the combined conductance of the channel, so that $I = g(V, t) \\cdot (V - E)$, or $I = g \\Delta{V}$.\n",
    "In other words, we assume that when a channel is open, the current through the channel is a passive current, linearly proportional to a voltage difference $(V - E)$, where $E$ is the Nernst or reversal potential, and is determined by the balance of _diffusion_ (particles moving randomly will eventually spread out more or less evenly) and the electrotonic attraction and repulsion caused by the particles' charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most of this tutorial, we'll assume that $g_\\text{max}$ and the parameters in the equations for $a$ and $r$ need to be identified, while the reversal potential $E$ can be estimated from the internal and external solutions used in the experiment."

    "### Rate equations\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"resources/gating.png\" width=\"552px\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables $a$ and $b$ are both described as simple chemical processes that can be in one of two states: _open_ ($O$) or _closed_ ($C$).\n",
    "Each state has a certain energy associated with it, and to make the transition between the two states an energy barrier needs to be overcome.\n",
    "The size of this barrier determines the transition rates in both directions $k_1$ and $k_2$.\n",
    "Note that the \"rate limiting step\" to get from one side of the barrier to the other is the \"uphill\" part of the curve, so that the rate going from $C$ to $O$ does not have to equal the rate from $O$ to $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In (physical) chemistry, a system like this is commonly described using the transition state theory, e.g. with the [Eyring equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyring_equation) but with an added term for the electrical energy, see [Tsien & Noble 1969](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01869785).\n",
    "The resulting rate equations contain a mixture of physical constants and model parameters, but can be reduced to the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$k_i = a_i \\cdot e ^ {b_i \\cdot V} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The values $a_i$ and $b_i$ of each rate will be specific to each current, and determining them is the main focus of this tutorial (along with the maximum conductance parameter, see below).\n",
    "Note that $a_i$ and $b_i$ decompose the rate into a voltage insensitive part $a_i$ and a voltage-sensitivity $b_i$.\n",
    "In the absense of voltage, we get $k_i(V = 0) = a_i$, so we can see that $a_i$ is a transition rate, in the same units and of roughly the same magnitude as $k_i$.\n",
    "Because the units of $x$ in $e^x$ must be dimensionless, we can see that $b_i$ must be in units of one over voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful stuff for fitting, as we've now already determined that all $a_i$ parameters must be positive rates, and since $e ^{-80\\text{mV}\\cdot b_i} = 1 / e^{80\\text{mV}\\cdot b_i}$ we can see that $b_i$ must be a pretty small number ($|b_i| < 1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about the sign of $b_i$?\n",
    "Looking back at the transition rate figure, we can imagine that the movement from $C$ to $O$ is some conformational change of the channel that involves moving a few charged amino acids through the electric gradient set up by the membrane potential.\n",
    "Now if the charges lie near one end of the membrane for $C$, near the other end for $O$, _and if the \"barrier\" is somewhere in between_, then it follows that one of the transitions will be aided by a positive $V$, while its reverse will be opposed by a positive $V$.\n",
    "If we follow [Tsien & Noble 1969](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01869785) in making this assumption, then we can add the $+$ and $-$ signs directly into the equations for the rates, and postulate that all $b_i$ parameters must be positive, $b > 0$.\n",
    "Can we justify this assumption?\n",
    "From first principle alone, we probably cannot: it might be also be possible that the rate limiting step of both transitions involves moving charges _in the same direction_ along or against the gradient.\n",
    "But experience with ion channels has shown that the simpler assumption describes their behaviour very well, so we will stick with this assumption in the remainder of this tutorial.\n"

    "\n",
    "We can use rate equations of the form above to write a differential equation for activation.\n",
    "Using $a$ for the fraction of activated channels, we see that the fraction of channels _not_ activated must be $1 - a$.\n",

    "$$\\frac{da}{dt} = k_1 - (k_1 + k_2) a = \\frac{\\frac{k1}{k1 + k2} - a}{\\frac{1}{k_1 + k_2}} = \\frac{a_\\infty - a}{\\tau_a}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is positive when $a < a_\\infty$, which will cause $a$ to move towards $a_\\infty$ over time.\n",
    "Similarly, it's negative when $a > a_\\infty$, so that again $a$ moves towards $a_\\infty$.\n",
    "When $a = a_\\infty = \\frac{k_1}{k_1 + k_2}$ the rate of change is zero.\n",
    "In other words, $a_\\infty$ is the action variable's _steady state_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate at which it moves towards its steady state is determined by $\\tau_a = \\frac{1}{k_1 + k_2}$, where a _larger_ value of $\\tau_a$ will cause the rate to be _slower_.\n",

    "### Gotcha: \"a priori unidentifiability\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to model an ion current is still an open question.\n",
    "Many modelling studies have used much more complex rate equations than $k = a e ^ {b V}$.\n",
    "A physical argument for these forms is not often given, so that it's difficult to determine whether these forms are really justified, or if maybe the same effect could (should?) have been obtained by using a more complex model structure).\n",
    "\n",
    "One nice thing about the $k = a e ^ {b V}$ form is that it decomposes each rate into just two bits of information: $a$ describes the overal rate of the transition, while $b$ describes its voltage dependence.\n",
    "If voltage is the only thing we vary during an experiment, this is probably the simplest form in which we can capture our observations.\n",
    "If temperature is also varied, the same reasoning (Eyring rate theory) leads naturally to a three-parameter form (see e.g. [Lei et al., BiophysJ 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2019.07.030)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of equations has a direct effect on how well we can parametrise the models.\n",
    "A model with too few parameters will never be able to fit the data.\n",
    "However, if a model has too many parameters, there will be multiple parameter sets that give the same result, rendering the \"correct\" parameter set _unidentifiable_.\n",
    "Determining whether a problem is identifiable or not can be difficult (see e.g. [Fink et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2008.0301)), but there are a few examples that appear in the literature where a model can be seen to be unidentifiable just by inspecting the equations.\n",
    "This is sometimes called _a priori unidentifiability_.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple example of a priori unidentifiability is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$k = p e ^ {q + rV}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The form above can be rewritten as $(p e^q)e^{rV} = a e^{bV}$ so that it reduces to the two parameter form.\n",
    "Only now there are infinitely many combinations $p e^q$ that give the same value for $a$.\n",
    "Using this formulation could make life unnecessarily difficult for an optimisation algorithm, but would also cause difficulty when comparing the results of repeated fits, e.g. fits to new data."

    "Comparing this protocol to the one shown in Figure 1 of the \"Rapid characterization\" paper, we can spot two big differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An important difference: The original staircase protocol contains two ramps, a \"leak ramp\" (at the start of the protocol) and a \"reversal ramp\" (at the end of the protocol). These ramps provide useful information to determine the size of the leak current, and to improve estimates of the reversal potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. An annoying difference: At the end of the plot, the protocol seems to shoot up to 0mV, even though this is never specified by the `mmt` file. \n",
    "\n",
    "What's going on? Careful reading of the docs shows us that the `log_for_interval` method returns data for a _closed interval_, containing both the initial and the final requested point. But steps of a `myokit.Protocol` are defined as half-open: they specify the voltage at the starting point of each step, right up until _but not including_ the voltage at the end of each step. Points that are not defined explicitly by the protocol are taken to be 0, explaining the apparent jump to 0mV at end of our plot. Implementation details like these are annoying, but crop up quite often when fitting, so it's good to be aware of them!"
