# Estimating parameters of action potential models

In this tutorial, we look at the problem of estimating the parameters (typically maximum conductances and permeabilities) of an action potential (AP) model.

Many of the principles from the ion channel tutorial apply here, so that you may want to read these first.
In contrast to the ion channel tutorials, these tutorials take a "recipe" approach, and do not provide much background or details.

The follow topics are covered:

## [Fitting conductances to an AP trace](basic-fitting-ap.ipynb)

A simple example of fitting to a single AP trace.

## [Fitting conductances to an AP and CaT trace](basic-fitting-ap-cat.ipynb)

Expands on the previous example to simultaneously fit to AP and calcium transient (CaT).
