## (TODO) Dealing with real data

Blah blah blah

These are sequential, not independent notebooks

- Introduction, and additive noise [![github](../img/github.svg)](real-data-1-noise.ipynb) [![nbviewer](../img/nbviewer.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CardiacModelling/fitting-notebooks/blob/main/ion-currents/real-data-1-noise.ipynb)
- Capacitance and series resistance [![github](../img/github.svg)](real-data-2-capacitance-and-resistance.ipynb) [![nbviewer](../img/nbviewer.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CardiacModelling/fitting-notebooks/blob/main/ion-currents/real-data-2-capacitance-and-resistance.ipynb)

- One
  - Four strategies
  - Noise model
  - Stochastic noise
  - Periodic noise
- Two
  - Pipette capacitance
  - Membrane capacitance

Sources:
- [x] Thermal, shot, mains, etc.
- [x] Stray capacitance
- [ ] Membrane capacitance
- [ ] Series resistance
- [ ] Leak
- [ ] Endogeneous currents
- [ ] Gating currents? (~100x smaller than ionic currents)

Things to be uncertain about
- [ ] Concentrations
- [ ] Reversal potential (Nernst/GHK graph?)
- [ ] Temperature
- [ ] Model discrepancy

Methods
- [x] Low-pass filter
- [x] Modelling noise
- [x] Stray cap correction
- [ ] Cm correction
- [ ] Artefact filtering
- [ ] Rs correction
- [ ] Subtraction protocol
- [ ] Leak correction
- [ ] Leak ramp
- [ ] Reversal potential ramp
