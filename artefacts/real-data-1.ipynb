    "In brief, a cell is placed in a bath containing an electrode (the _bath electrode_) and an ion-rich solution that can conduct electricity.\n",
    "A patch clamp _pipette_ is constructed by heating and mechanically pulling a small glass tube, then filling it with another ion-rich solution, and inserting an electrode into the open end.\n",
    "The sharp end of the pipette is then placed against the cell membrane and suction, electric pulses, or chemicals are used to break the membrane inside the pipette opening, thereby establishing a connection to the inside of the cell.\n",
    "A _patch clamp amplifier_ is attached to both electrodes, and can now be used to measure and manipulate the voltage between the bath and pipette electrodes.\n"
