    "# Modelling patch-clamp experiments: compensation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [last notebook](./artefacts-1-modelling-patch-clamp.ipynb), we introduced an electrical schematic that can serve as a model of the patch-clamp set up, with distortions by leak, offsets, and unwanted capacitances.\n",
    "To compensate for these unwanted effects, patch-clamp amplifiers contain special circuitry.\n",
    "In this notebook we extend our model to include the effects of these compensations, as modelled in [Lei et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2019.0348).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will deal mostly with _transient_ distortions of the recorded output signal, which we call _artefacts_, and with transient differences between the true and intended membrane potential, which are an example of _imperfect control_.\n",
    "These terms, and general strategies for dealing with their effects, are discussed in [Appendix H](./appendix-H-strategies.ipynb).\n",
    "Stochastic and periodic noise are not discussed here, but a brief discussion is given in [Appendix I](./appendix-I-inspecting-noise.ipynb)."

    "\n",
    "A liquid junction potential (LJP) arises wherever two liquids containing different concentrations of ions are in contact.\n",
    "In manual patch clamp this is the case just before the experiment, when the pipette is in the bath but not yet attached to the cell.\n",
    "The correction $E_\\text{off}*$ is usually determined just before the final approach to the cell, and so includes this LJP.\n",
    "Once a connection to the cell is made, the pipette fluid is in contact with the cytosol and because both fluids are similar an LJP no longer exists.\n",
    "In other words, the LJP is removed from $E_\\text{off}$, but not from $E_\\text{off}^*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correction for this overcorrection is called LJP correction, and proceeds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The LJP is calculated by entering the bath and pipette solutions into an LJP calculating program.\n",
    "2. We can then adjust all $V_\\text{cmd}$ values to obtain the desired $V_m$ (*a priori* correction) or simply accept that $V_m$ is shifted from the desired value and account for this in our analysis (*a posteriori* correction). \n",
    "\n",
    "Some systems allow the LJP to be entered into the recording software, so that *a priori* correction can be performed without further user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "A detailed description of the correction procedure is provided in [Appendix J](./appendix-J-liquid-junction-potential.ipynb).\n",
    "In short, if you have to do manual *a posteriori* correction then you **subtract** the LJP from the applied or measured voltage to get the true value."
