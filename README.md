# Fitting electrophysiology models with Myokit & PINTS

This repository contains examples showing how to fit Myokit models to data using the PINTS optimisation & inference framework.
It includes:

- a [brief example](action-potential-example/README.md) of fitting (whole-cell) conductances to an action potential (AP) trace; and
- a [detailed tutorial](ion-currents-tutorial/README.md) showing how to fit kinetic parameters of ion current models.

The AP model example is a great place to start if you've done fitting before, and would like to spend five minutes seeing how it can be done with Myokit and PINTS.
The ion current tutorial goes into much more depth, and includes topics that are useful in AP model fitting too, such as defining boundaries and parameter transformations.

## General recommendations

**Start with a synthetic data study:**
Before going to the lab, work out what data you expect to get, simulate this data and add noise, prepare your analysis code, and test that it can recover the parameters you used to generate the data.

**Fit to time-series data:**
Whenever possible, fit to time-series data, not to "summary statistics" or "biomarkers" such as time constants, IV-, or (in)activation curves.
Contacting experimenters, digging in archives, or even repeating experiments is a better use of time than trying to fit to data not suitable for fitting to.

**Define expected ranges for the parameters:**
Define boundaries on the parameters (or on e.g. rates derived from the parameters).
These speed up your search, but are also used to..

**Verify the reliability of your results:** by running repeated fits.
Restart your fit several (50?) times from different positions sampled from within the feasible ranges of the parameters.
If only a handful of fits find the same "best result", it's likely this isn't the true optimum.

**Check your solver tolerances**: if using an adaptive step-size solver, make sure you use strict tolerances.
If you're not sure, plot the error measure along a line between two nearby points: if it's nice and smooth the optimiser will love it.

**Search in a log-transformed parameter space**: We're not quite sure why [but it helps](https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz020).

**Use the CMA-ES optimiser**: It performs much better on these problems than anything else we've tested.
